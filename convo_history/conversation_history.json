Look for this information to get the most accurate details.\n*   **Ask Directly at the Restaurant:** The most reliable way to determine if a specific item is gluten-free is to ask the staff directly at the KFC location you plan to visit.\n*   **Consider Simple Items:** Some plain, unbreaded items like grilled chicken (if available) or certain side salads (without croutons or creamy dressings) might be naturally gluten-free. However, always verify preparation methods to avoid cross-contamination.\n*   **Be Aware of Cross-Contamination:** Fast food environments often have shared cooking equipment, increasing the risk of cross-contamination. If you are highly sensitive to gluten, it may be best to choose restaurants with dedicated gluten-free preparation areas.\n\n",

Here's what to consider:\n\n*   **Salads:** Choose salads without croutons or with dressings that are confirmed to be gluten-free. Ask the staff about the ingredients in the dressings.\n*   **Bowls:** When ordering bowls, confirm that the rice or noodle base is gluten-free. Brown rice or cauli rice may be good options. Ensure that any sauces or toppings are also gluten-free.\n*   **Wraps and Sandwiches:** These are less likely to be gluten-free due to the bread/wrap.\n\n**To confirm gluten-free options:**\n\n*   **Contact the Restaurant Directly:** Call Project-Hum at +919137883053.\n*   **Visit in Person:** Enquire about gluten-free options and preparation methods.\n*   **Check the Website:** Visit their website at [https://magicpin.in/Mumbai/Pali-Hill/Restaurant/Project-Hum/store/154790a/](https://magicpin.in/Mumbai/Pali-Hill/Restaurant/Project-Hum/store/154790a/) for any allergen information.\n",
